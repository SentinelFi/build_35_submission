## Products & Services

**Sentinel Protocol** is a **parametric insurance framework** built on the **Soroban**. It is designed to provide a trustless, automated, and transparent service for users who want to hedge against real-world risks and for investors who seek to assume those risks in exchange for yield. The protocol uses smart contracts and decentralized oracles to create efficient insurance markets where intermediaries are not required. The protocol operates as a parametric system where claims are triggered automatically based on verified external data. This means there are no claim adjusters and no processing delays. Sentinel is modular, which makes it adaptable to any risk category where reliable oracle data is available.

The current Proof of Concept is **Flight Delay Insurance**, which provides protection to users whose flights are delayed beyond a specified duration, (e.g., 6 hours). Payouts are handled automatically, which shows how powerful on-chain insurance can be when it is fast, fair, and open to everyone.

Sentinel Protocol offers the foundation for a new generation of decentralized insurance products that are scalable, interoperable, and designed for a modern, data-driven world.
